# Insurance_Cost_Analysis

In this project we analyze health insurance data and use regression analysis to predict Insurance charges for individuals with specific health and geographic aspects. The insurance dataset consists of 1,338 entries and houses the following columns as features:
1. Age
2. Sex
3. BMI
4. Smoker (Yes/No)

The Variable that we would like to predict is the total insurance claim amount (Charges). The smoker column is a dummy a column divided into values of 1 (for smokers) and 0 (non-smokers)
